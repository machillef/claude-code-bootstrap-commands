# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context and any existing docs/ai/ files, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Context Loading

Before starting, read all existing docs/ai/ files for this initiative:
- `docs/ai/<initiative>-requirements.md` (if exists — new-repo workflow)
- `docs/ai/<initiative>-scope-map.md` (if exists — existing-repo workflow)
- `docs/ai/<initiative>-decisions.md` (if exists)
- `CLAUDE.md` (project root, if exists)

Use this context to ground your questions and avoid asking what's already documented.

## Anti-Pattern: "This Is Too Simple To Need A Design"

Every project goes through this process. A todo list, a single-function utility, a config change — all of them. "Simple" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The design can be short (a few sentences for truly simple projects), but you MUST present it and get approval.

## Checklist

You MUST complete these steps in order:

1. **Load initiative context** — read docs/ai/ files, CLAUDE.md, recent commits
2. **Offer visual companion** (if topic will involve visual questions) — this is its own message, not combined with a clarifying question. See the Visual Companion section below.
3. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria
4. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation
5. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section
6. **Write design doc** — save to `docs/ai/<initiative>-design.md` and commit
7. **Spec review loop** — dispatch spec-document-reviewer subagent with precisely crafted review context (never your session history); fix issues and re-dispatch until approved (max 5 iterations, then surface to human)
8. **User reviews written spec** — ask user to review the spec file before proceeding
9. **Return control** — hand back to the calling workflow skill (do NOT invoke implementation skills directly)

## Process Flow

```
Load context → Visual companion offer? → Clarifying questions (one at a time)
→ Propose 2-3 approaches → Present design sections → User approves?
  → No: revise and re-present
  → Yes: Write design doc → Spec review loop → User reviews spec
    → Changes requested: update and re-review
    → Approved: Return control to calling workflow
```

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**

- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits, existing docs/ai/ files)
- Before asking detailed questions, assess scope: if the request describes multiple independent subsystems (e.g., "build a platform with chat, file storage, billing, and analytics"), flag this immediately. Don't spend questions refining details of a project that needs to be decomposed first.
- If the project is too large for a single spec, help the user decompose into sub-projects: what are the independent pieces, how do they relate, what order should they be built? Then brainstorm the first sub-project through the normal design flow.
- For appropriately-scoped projects, ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message — if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**

- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**

- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Scale each section to its complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if nuanced
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

**Design for isolation and clarity:**

- Break the system into smaller units that each have one clear purpose, communicate through well-defined interfaces, and can be understood and tested independently
- For each unit, you should be able to answer: what does it do, how do you use it, and what does it depend on?
- Can someone understand what a unit does without reading its internals? Can you change the internals without breaking consumers? If not, the boundaries need work.

**Working in existing codebases:**

- Explore the current structure before proposing changes. Follow existing patterns.
- Where existing code has problems that affect the work (e.g., a file that's grown too large, unclear boundaries, tangled responsibilities), include targeted improvements as part of the design.
- Don't propose unrelated refactoring. Stay focused on what serves the current goal.

## After the Design

**Documentation:**

- Write the validated design to `docs/ai/<initiative>-design.md`
  - (User preferences for spec location override this default)
- Commit the design document to git

**Spec Review Loop:**
After writing the spec document:

1. Dispatch spec-document-reviewer subagent (see Spec Document Reviewer section below)
2. If Issues Found: fix, re-dispatch, repeat until Approved
3. If loop exceeds 5 iterations, surface to human for guidance

**User Review Gate:**
After the spec review loop passes, ask the user to review the written spec before proceeding:

> "Spec written and committed to `<path>`. Please review it and let me know if you want to make any changes before we continue."

Wait for the user's response. If they request changes, make them and re-run the spec review loop. Only proceed once the user approves.

**Return Control:**
After user approves the spec, return control to the calling workflow. Do NOT invoke implementation skills directly. The workflow will continue with its next step (stack decision, slice definition, etc.).

## Spec Document Reviewer

Dispatch as a subagent (Agent tool, general-purpose type) with this prompt:

```
You are a spec document reviewer. Verify this spec is complete and ready for planning.

**Spec to review:** [SPEC_FILE_PATH]

## What to Check

| Category | What to Look For |
|----------|------------------|
| Completeness | TODOs, placeholders, "TBD", incomplete sections |
| Coverage | Missing error handling, edge cases, integration points |
| Consistency | Internal contradictions, conflicting requirements |
| Clarity | Ambiguous requirements |
| YAGNI | Unrequested features, over-engineering |
| Scope | Focused enough for a single plan — not covering multiple independent subsystems |
| Architecture | Units with clear boundaries, well-defined interfaces, independently understandable and testable |

## CRITICAL

Look especially hard for:
- Any TODO markers or placeholder text
- Sections saying "to be defined later" or "will spec when X is done"
- Sections noticeably less detailed than others
- Units that lack clear boundaries or interfaces

## Output Format

## Spec Review

**Status:** Approved | Issues Found

**Issues (if any):**
- [Section X]: [specific issue] - [why it matters]

**Recommendations (advisory):**
- [suggestions that don't block approval]
```

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** — Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** — Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** — Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** — Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** — Present design, get approval before moving on
- **Be flexible** — Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense

## Visual Companion

A browser-based companion for showing mockups, diagrams, and visual options during brainstorming. Available as a tool — not a mode. Accepting the companion means it's available for questions that benefit from visual treatment; it does NOT mean every question goes through the browser.

**Offering the companion:** When you anticipate that upcoming questions will involve visual content (mockups, layouts, diagrams), offer it once for consent:
> "Some of what we're working on might be easier to explain if I can show it to you in a web browser. I can put together mockups, diagrams, comparisons, and other visuals as we go. Want to try it? (Requires opening a local URL)"

**This offer MUST be its own message.** Do not combine it with clarifying questions, context summaries, or any other content. Wait for the user's response before continuing. If they decline, proceed with text-only brainstorming.

**Per-question decision:** Even after the user accepts, decide FOR EACH QUESTION whether to use the browser or the terminal. The test: **would the user understand this better by seeing it than reading it?**

- **Use the browser** for content that IS visual — mockups, wireframes, layout comparisons, architecture diagrams, side-by-side visual designs
- **Use the terminal** for content that is text — requirements questions, conceptual choices, tradeoff lists, A/B/C/D text options, scope decisions

**Note:** The visual companion requires a local server. If the Superpowers plugin is installed, its `scripts/start-server.sh` can be used. If not, fall back to text-only brainstorming — the visual companion is optional, not required.
